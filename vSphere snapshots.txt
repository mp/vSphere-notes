"Snapshot error on the server."

Snapshots create link errors and can take up a lot of space, or little at all. They are unreliable, and not a form of backup. You should only leave a snapshot for a few days, or a week at the most.

Rule: Only have 2 snaphots at home, and one snapshot at work.
Consolidate snapshots often. This does not delete the snapshot or merge up (like in Professional), it just cleans up the broken links but leaves the snapshot for you to delete.

If you are going to do upgrade experiments on a shared server, you should clone the server and do it on that. Then, redo the steps on the public server. This is probably less necessary at home, but a shared workspace is a perfect example of why that is important. Being snapshot happy can fill up space and kill the server - always mess around with a clone server.

Snapshot manager.

snapshot 1
	snapshot 2
		Create files a, b
		snapshot 3
			o You are here
			

Points to note:
You have too many snapshots. 2 is the maximum you should have at home (1 at work).
You can delete snapshot 1 and 2, which still leaves 3.
You can delete snapshot 1, 2 and 3, which still leaves "You are here".The files a,b will remain because you did not revert to snapshot 1 or 2.
The act of reverting takes you out of the current state and into and old one.


You can delete intermediate snapshots, but do so after a consolidation when the machine is powered off.
